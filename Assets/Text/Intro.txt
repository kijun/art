When he landed on the planet
he got out his shovel and started to dig.

You see, he was looking for something.
Something that made him feel whole again.
He was the best digger out there, he was sure of it.

Sometimes he had curious visitors,
sometimes they even fell in love.

But soon enough, he felt it once more,
his missing piece, his nothingness.
The fear drove him to his work.

They waited, sometimes for a very long time.
But patience has its limits and so
they got on their ship and
went on with their lives.

"What if the next shovel does it?"

He cried but no one was there to listen.

Slowly he picked up his shovel
and got ready to leave.
