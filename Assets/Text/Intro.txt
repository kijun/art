When he landed on the planet
he got out his shovel and started to dig.

You see, he was looking for something.

He wasn't sure what it was,
but he knew that if he saw it,
he'd recognize it.

So he kept digging.

Sometimes he had curious visitors,
sometimes they even fell in love.

But soon enough, he felt something missing again.
The fear drove him to his work.

They waited, sometimes for a very long time.

But eventually, they left him and
went on with their lives.

He was alone when he received the news:

[Approaching Meteor Shower,
 Everyone Must Evacuate]

"What if the next shovel does it?"

He cried out but there was no one to listen.

Slowly he picked up his shovel
and boarded his ship.
